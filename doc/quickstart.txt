DiffKit QuickStart
====================
@AUTHOR@
v@VERSION@, @BUILDDATE@ (SVN @REVISION@)

Prerequisites 
-------------
Ensure that you have first read the link:README.html[README file].


Verifying your environment 
--------------------------
The DiffKit standalone application carries with it a complete functional test
suite. In order to verify that the standalone application works properly in your
particular environment, you should first execute the functional test suite:
-------------------------------
   java -jar diffkit-app.jar -test
-------------------------------
The resulting output should report that all tests PASSED. If any test FAILED,
please report the failure to the DiffKit user group
http://groups.google.com/group/diffkit-user[diffkit-user] as soon as possible,
and don't use DiffKit.


Diff'ng
-------
DiffKit allows you to select two _Sources_ (a Left Hand Source and a Right Hand
Source) of tabular data for comparison on a value-by-value basis, and to send
the results of the comparison (diffs) to a _Sink_ (typically a structured file).
You must specify the _Sources_ and _Sink_ to DiffKit via an XML configuration
file, called a _plan_ file. The "eg/" directory in the DiffKit distribution
(zip) contains many examples of such plan files.


Diff'ng File tables
-------------------
test9.plan.xml, in the eg/ directory, is a very simple _plan_ file that
instructs DiffKit to compare two csv files: test9.lhs.csv, and test9.rhs.csv.
The output (diffs) will be sent to a file named test9.sink.diff. You can invoke
the DiffKit standalone application to run this _plan_ file. From the
distribution directory:
-----------------
cd eg/
java -jar ../diffkit-app.jar -planfiles test9.plan.xml
-----------------
DiffKit prints a summary of the results to the console:
-----------------
diff'd 8 rows in 0:00:00.009, found:
!4 row diffs
@2 column diffs
-----------------
The summary tells us that there were 4 row diffs; a row diff occurs when DiffKit
finds a row on one side, but no corresponding row on the other side. Rows are
uniquely identified by a _key_ (analogous to a primary key in relational DBs)
which defaults to column1 if not otherwise specified.

Modularizing the config files
