DiffKit QuickStart
====================
@AUTHOR@
v@VERSION@, @BUILDDATE@ (SVN @REVISION@)

Prerequisites 
-------------
Ensure that you have first read the link:README.html[README file].


Verifying your environment 
--------------------------
The DiffKit standalone application carries with it a complete functional test
suite. In order to verify that the standalone application works properly in your
particular environment, you should first execute the functional test suite:
-------------------------------
   java -jar diffkit-app.jar -test
-------------------------------
The resulting output should report that all tests PASSED. If any test FAILED, 
please report the failure to the DiffKit user group http://groups.google.com/group/diffkit-user[diffkit-user]
as soon as possible, and don't use DiffKit.


Diff'ng
-------
DiffKit allows you to select two _Sources_ (a Left Hand Source and a Right Hand
Source) of tabular data for comparison on a value-by-value basis, and to send
the results of the comparison (diffs) to a _Sink_ (typically a structured file). 
You must specify the _Sources_ and _Sink_ to DiffKit via an XML configuration file,
called a _plan_ file. The "eg/" directory in the DiffKit distribution (zip) contains
many examples of such plan files.
