Description
----------
Compare spreadsheet tables using mostly automatic default provided by the MagicPlan. Plan specifies keyColumnNames, 
which are different from the default keyColumn (COLUMN1). If alignment was carried out using 
default (COLUMN1), all rows would be row diffs. Instead, engine is able to align the rows and produce only column diffs
because of the keyColumnName override (column3).

Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are SpreadSheet FILE tables
- lhs vs. rhs has no diffs
- plan file supplies lhs  and rhs spreadsheet file paths
- plan file supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the spreadsheet
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs
column based on name 

Expectations
-----------
- No Diffs
