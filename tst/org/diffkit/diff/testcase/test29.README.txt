Description
----------
Compare SpreadSheet tables using a PassthroughPlan. Demonstrates targeting an 
explicitly named sheet, rather than defaulting to first sheet. Also demonstrates
a SpreadSheet with many different data types.

Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are SpreadSheet FILE tables
- lhs vs. rhs has no diffs
- plan file supplies lhs  and rhs spreadsheet file paths
- plan file supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the spreadsheet
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs
column based on name 

Expectations
-----------
- No Diffs
