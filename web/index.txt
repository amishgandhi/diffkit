DiffKit is an application, and a framework, for comparing two
tables of data, field-by-field. It is Free Open Source Software (FOSS).

DiffKit is able to report the differences (__Diff__s)
at both the row and field level, and allows the user to configure how to carry
out the comparison (what to compare, what to ignore). DiffKit is highly
customizable with respect to the sources of tabular data, the details of the
comparison, and the characteristics of the diff report (output). For instance,
DiffKit is able to diff CSV files, RDBMS tables, or custom data sources, in any
combination.

DiffKit was written in Java by *Joe Panico*.
