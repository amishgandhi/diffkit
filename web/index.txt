What
----
DiffKit is an application, and a framework, for comparing two
tables of data, field-by-field. The tables can come from any of a number of
sources, such as an RDBMS or CSV file, and DiffKit is able to mix different
kinds of sources in the same diff operation. DiffKit is like the Unix _diff_
utility, but for tables instead of lines of text.

DiffKit is able to report the _diffs_ at both the row and field level, and
allows the user to configure the comparison (what to compare, how to compare it,
what to ignore). DiffKit is highly customizable with respect to the sources of
tabular data, the details of the comparison, and the characteristics of the
output (diff report).

Why
---

DiffKit is Free Open Source Software (FOSS), licensed under the Apache License,
Version 2.0. DiffKit was designed specifically with _Enterprise Diff'ng_ in
mind. It supports very high data volume operations (tens of millions of rows).
It is a command line utility, driven by text configuration files, and as such is
very well suited to scripting, automated operation, and embedding into Unix
workflows.

The principal use of DiffKit is for regression testing processes that create or
manipulate persistent table data:

____
Relational database management systems (RDBMSs) often persist mission-critical
data which is updated by many applications and potentially thousands if not
millions of end users. Furthermore, they implement important functionality in
the form of database methods (stored procedures, stored functions, and/or
triggers) and database objects (e.g. Java or C# instances). The best way to
ensure the continuing quality of these assets, at least from a technical point
of view, you should have a full regression test suite which you can run on a
regular basis.

DiffKit is also well suited for comparing SQL table *structures*, not just SQL
table data. It is not uncommon in an enterprise development shop to have many
different copies of, what is presumably, the same database. In this cases, it is
critically important to either keep the DDL in synch across all of these copies,
or to at least understand how they differ. DiffKit is able to give you perfect
visibility into the differences between the definition of database objects.
